Exploring the tags in the British Library flickr repository (and beyond)

This project is a place for notes and code to experiment in getting and exploring the tags used in Flickr around content uploaded by various institutions. Specifically The British Library in the first instance.

Based on an idea from Giles Lane and through some initial discussions on a project that could use the flickr held content and Bookleteer.
