# A brief experiment

Using an existing node.js library, https://github.com/flickr/flickr-sdk I used a basic script to make the API call to get the tags for a user, in this case the British Library user.

The resulting response is a Gateway timeout. 

(The code is in the experiments folder, script test1.js)
