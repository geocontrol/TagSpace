# From the Library's Mouth

After the experiments the end of last week I discovered that Flickr's API gateway was just not going to return the data that I wanted just from the standard calls. With this in mind I started thinking about the other ways of getting the data, but I also posted a message on twitter:

```
@marksimpkins:
ok, any flickr API experts? I’m using flickr.tags.getListUser to get the tags used by the British Library, but it appears to time out??
```

Which was noticed by Nora McGregor (@ndalyrose) who retweeted a message to someone who might have some more information

```
@ndalyrose:
.@benosteen might have some insights...
```

Both Nora McGregor and Ben O'Steen work at the British Library

A brief conversation with Ben happened over the weekend

```
@benosteen: 
@ndalyrose @marksimpkins we've used 100k+ tags so that call will likely never return. We've found most of the aggregate Flickr api calls fail on the BL collection.
```

```
benosteen: 
@marksimpkins @ndalyrose There is this dataset that you might find helpful? data.bl.uk/digbks/db15.ht…
```
(The full link is https://data.bl.uk/digbks/db15.html)

```
benosteen: 
@marksimpkins @ndalyrose I'm not sure if you have found this too? github.com/BL-Labs/imaged… the tags we applied are just metadata derived so can be deduced.
```
(Again, the full link is https://github.com/BL-Labs/imagedirectory/blob/master/README.md)

This gives us access to s dataset of the tags on BL content up to
